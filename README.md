RayCarla is a **large scale** autonomous driving research platform. 
* Simulation: Carla simulator.
* Imitative Learning on Ray to support distributed deep learning.
* Reinforcement Learning on Ray (WIP).
* Carla on Ray to support distributed simulation (WIP).
* Ray Serve to support distributed inference (WIP).
* Leverage Ray Dataset for distributed data ingestion (WIP).

## QuickStart

Follow [raycarla.ipynb](https://github.com/xzrderek/RayCarla/blob/main/raycarla.ipynb) notebook to enjoy!

## Development
Please follow [DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/xzrderek/RayCarla/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md) to setup environment.

## Performance
The training time has been reduced from 20 hours to 3 hours after Ray enale the training on 8 GPUs in parallel.
