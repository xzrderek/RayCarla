RayCarla is a **large scale** autonomous driving research platform. 
* Carla simulator.
* Carla on Ray to support distributive simulation (WIP).
* Imitative Learning on Ray to support distributive deep learning. (mutli model training)
* Reinforcement Learning on Ray (WIP).
* Autonomous Driving Interpretability (WIP).
* Leverage Ray Dataset for pipelining... (Planning).
